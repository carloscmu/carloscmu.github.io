keywords = {equilibrium cyber risk, cybersecurity, cyberattacks, hacks},
abstract = {I develop a simple model to study how the interplay between institutions' and hackers' incentives can alter cyber risk within an equilibrium context. By formalizing the strategic interaction between institutions and hackers, the model characterizes how changes in heterogeneity across institutions, cybersecurity technologies, and hacker competition can lead to material shifts in cyber risk.},

keywords = {treasury, triparty repos, short-term funding, overnight repos},
abstract = {Using a confidential and comprehensive dataset, we show that the pricing of overnight Treasury tri-party repos significantly varies across market participants and depends on three factors: (1) the number of counterparties that participants often trade with, (2) the degree of trading diversification across those counterparties, and (3) the share of trading volume those counterparties account for. We also find that the pricing impact of these factors are sensitive to market conditions.},

abstract = {Changes in the propagation of shocks along firm networks are important to understanding aggregate and cross-sectional features of stock returns. When calibrated to match key characteristics of supplier-customer networks in the United States, a model in which firms are interlinked via enduring relationships generates long-run consumption risks, high and volatile risk premiums, and a small and stable risk-free rate. The model also matches cross-sectional patterns of portfolio returns sorted by firm centrality, a feature unaccounted for by standard asset pricing models.},

As uncertainty affects the perception of contagion risk, it can reshape market equilibrium inefficiencies, altering the scope of welfare-improving interventions. The socially optimal level of uncertainty depends on a delicate balance between the information technologies available to policymakers and structural features of the network.},
