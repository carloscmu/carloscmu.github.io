    - title: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2025.112307">On Equilibrium Cyber Risk.</a> Economics Letters. 
      year: April 2025
      items: 
        - I develop a simple model to study how the interplay between institutions’ and hackers’ incentives can alter cyber risk within an equilibrium context. By formalizing the strategic interaction between institutions and hackers, the model characterizes how changes in heterogeneity across institutions, cybersecurity technologies, and hacker competition can lead to material shifts in cyber risk.
    - title: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhae032">Firm Networks and Asset Returns.</a> Review of Financial Studies. 
      year: Oct 2024
      items: 
        - Changes in the propagation of shocks along firm networks are important to understanding aggregate and cross-sectional features of stock returns. When calibrated to match key characteristics of supplier–customer networks in the United States, a model in which firms are interlinked via enduring relationships generates long-run consumption risks, high and volatile risk premiums, and a small and stable risk-free rate. The model also matches cross-sectional patterns of portfolio returns sorted by firm centrality, a feature unaccounted for by standard asset pricing models.
    - title: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165176524001599">On the Anatomy of Cyberattacks.</a> Economics Letters. 
      year: Apr 2024
      items: 
        - <i>Joint with Jin-Wook Chang, Kartik Jayachandran, and Ali Tintera.</i> 
        - Using detailed information on cyberattacks and establishments in the United States, we study whether and how an establishment’s characteristics can alter the likelihood of cyberattacks. We find that larger establishments and establishments of publicly traded companies are more likely targets.      
    - title: <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-dynamics-of-the-us-overnight-triparty-repo-market-20210802.html">The Dynamics of the U.S. Overnight Triparty Repo Market.</a> FEDS Notes. 
      year: Aug 2021
      items: 
        - <i>Joint with Mark E. Paddrik and  Matthew J. McCormick.</i> 
        - Using supervisory transaction-level data, this note provides an overview of the pricing and clearing process of overnight triparty repos. We present novel facts about how this segment behaves, emphasizing the role that participants, collateral, and trading relationships play in its pricing and clearing process.      
    - title: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.12.002">Imperfect information transmission from banks to investors Macroeconomic implications.</a> Journal of Monetary Economics.
      year: Mar 2021
      items: 
        - <i>Joint with Nicolás Figueroa and Oksana Leukhina.</i> 
        - We study the interaction between screening and information production in loan-backed asset markets wherein credit ratings are prone to error. Conventional regulatory policies can exacerbate credit misallocation by reducing the informational value of high credit ratings. We propose a tax/subsidy scheme that increases efficiency.

    - title: Supply Chain Risk and Inflation Dynamics. 
      year: Aug 2025
      items: 
      - I propose a measure of the U.S. economy’s exposure to supply chain disruptions by integrating stock market data with information on supplier--customer linkages and input specificity. The proposed measure improves inflation forecasts and provides insights into inflation tail risk, particularly at longer horizons.
    - title: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FmGM23g437ISTV24UKeXxYNwAg6HKJuk/view">The Anatomy of Contagion and Macroprudential Policies.</a> 
      year: Mar 2024
      items: 
      - I propose a model to highlight the relevance of basic characteristics of the structural makeup of contagion for the design of macroprudential policies. Besides characterizing optimal policies under a variety of environments, I show that failing to incorporate said characteristics can lead to inappropriate strategies for crisis prevention.
    - title: Treasury Triparty Repo Pricing. 
      year: Feb 2024
      items: 
      - <i>Joint with Mark E. Paddrik.</i> 
      - Using a comprehensive transaction-level dataset, we show that the pricing of overnight treasury triparty repos is far from uniform across market participants and depends on a delicate interplay between three factors (1) the number of counterparties, (2) counterparty diversification, and (3) how actively such counterparties trade. Importantly, this interplay can be reshaped in times of stress.

      year: Mar 2022
      items: 
      - I develop a model for studying the role that uncertainty about the susceptibility of a financial network to contagion plays in the behavior of its member institutions and the design of preemptive interventions. As uncertainty affects the perception of contagion risk, it can reshape market equilibrium inefficiencies, altering the scope of welfare-improving interventions. The socially optimal level of uncertainty depends on a delicate balance between the information technologies available to policymakers and structural features of the network.
