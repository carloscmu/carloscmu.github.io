      description: Joint with Mark E. Paddrik and  Matthew J. McCormick. Abstract: Using supervisory transaction-level data, this note provides an overview of the pricing and clearing process of overnight triparty repos. We present novel facts about how this segment behaves, emphasizing the role that participants, collateral, and trading relationships play in its pricing and clearing process.

      description: Joint with Nicolás Figueroa and Oksana Leukhina. Abstract: We study the interaction between screening and information production in loan-backed asset markets wherein credit ratings are prone to error. Conventional regulatory policies can exacerbate credit misallocation by reducing the informational value of high credit ratings. We propose a tax/subsidy scheme that increases efficiency.

    - title: Treasury Triparty Repo Pricing. 
      year: February 2024
      description: Joint with Mark E. Paddrik. Abstract: Using a comprehensive transaction-level dataset, we show that the pricing of overnight treasury triparty repos is far from being uniform across market participants and depends on a delicate interplay among (1) the number of counterparties, (2) counterparty diversification, and (3) how actively such counterparties trade. Importantly, this interplay can be reshaped in times of stress.

      year: January 2024
      description:  Joint with Jin-Wook Chang, Kartik Jayachandran, and Ali Tintera. Abstract: We construct a new data set with detailed information on cyberattacks and establishments in the United States and estimate how an establishment’s characteristics can alter the likelihood of being the target of cyberattacks. We find that larger establishments and establishments of public institutions are more likely to be targets. Our findings are robust to a battery of controls and consistent with the idea that cyberattacks could impose significant adverse effects in economies wherein larger institutions play a more significant role.

      year: November 2023
      description: Revision requested at The Review of Financial Studies. Abstract: Changes in the propagation of shocks along firm networks are important to understanding aggregate and cross-sectional features of stock returns. When calibrated to match key characteristics of supplier-customer networks in the United States, a model in which firms are interlinked via enduring relationships generates long-run consumption risks, high and volatile risk premiums, and a small and stable risk-free rate. The model also matches cross-sectional patterns of portfolio returns sorted by firm centrality, a feature unaccounted for by standard asset pricing models.

      year: March 2022
      description: I develop a model for studying the role that uncertainty about the susceptibility of a financial network to contagion plays in the behavior of its member institutions and the design of preemptive interventions. As uncertainty affects the perception of contagion risk, it can reshape market equilibrium inefficiencies, altering the scope of welfare-improving interventions. The socially optimal level of uncertainty depends on a delicate balance between the information technologies available to policymakers and structural features of the network.
