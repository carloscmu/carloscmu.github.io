A group of colleagues and I just published a short note exploring how supply-chain risk can affect bank lending behavior during periods of heightened trade policy uncertainty.
You can find the note <a href= 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/supply-chain-risk-and-bank-lending-amid-trade-policy-uncertainty-20260130.html'>here</a>.
